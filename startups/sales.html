I believe structured knowledge and process is the best way to increase the probability of process success (also structured, for me, means measurable).
Framework for Revenue generation — sales process (for any business)
Dave McClure, venture capitalist, angel investor, founder of startup accelerator 500 Startups, introduced the world to a 5-step framework for each business growth (in terms of generating revenue). That framework was called AARRR, or also the Pirate Metrics.

## Main marketing channels (19) defined in the framework

The Bullseye Framework proposes that you look at all 19 channels that can drive traffic to your website or product, but after brainstorming every channel, focus on one channel and test its success for your business in a small scale version. If you see progress, scale that channel. If not, move on to testing another channel. It’s basically an acquisition channel testing version of the MVP process.
